## RGBD-Inertial Trajectory Estimation and Mapping for Small Ground Rescue Robot
Based one open source SLAM framework [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono).

The approach contains
+ Depth-integrated visual-inertial initialization process.
+ Visual-inertial odometry by utilizing depth information while avoiding the limitation is working for 3D pose estimation.
+ Noise elimination map which is suitable for path planning and navigation.

However, the proposed approach can also be applied to other application like handheld and wheeled robot.

This dataset is part of the dataset collection of the [STAR Center](https://star-center.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng): https://star-datasets.github.io/
